![Cover](content/cover.png)

**This is the class manual for the project seminar Computational Ethology at the Ruhr-University Bochum for the Winter Semester 2021/22.**

In the following pages we will learn what we mean by behavior and how we can measure it. We will discuss common issues and apply some machine learning to track body parts with [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut), triangulate coordinated with [Anipose](https://github.com/lambdaloop/anipose) and classify behavior motifs with [VAME](https://github.com/LINCellularNeuroscience/VAME).
