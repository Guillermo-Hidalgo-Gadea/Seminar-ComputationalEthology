:::{admonition} What about Covid-19?
:class: question, dropdown
Unfortunately, the effects of the pandemic still determine life on campus, and the situation keeps changing so rapidly, that we need to stay flexible. As for the winter term 2021/22, in-person seminars are allowed at the Ruhr-University Bochum with proof of vaccination (or 3G regulation), regular ventilation in seminar rooms, keeping a distance of at least 1.5m between students and surgical face masks to be worn inside RUB buildings. Up to date information on changing Covid-19 regulations can be seen [here](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/general-information-about-corona).    
Nevertheless, this seminar has been deliberately designed to be interactive enough to be used as a tool for independent learning from home, in case the seminar has to be moved online.
